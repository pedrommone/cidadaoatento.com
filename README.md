Collaborative troubleshooter for  cities!

Cidad√£o Atento is my TCC (something like course conclusion project), it was developed in 2012 when I was 17 years old. We got a stand to show our work at Tecnofeira hosted by Cotemig (tech school). We did not win any prize, but it was a good experience for our carrer.

The project was made on top of Google Maps and CodeIgniter; some libraries such as Bootstrap have been used too.
